# Node-Classification-GNN
.  Project Name: "Node-Level Classification on Citation Networks using Graph Neural Networks"

.  Project Summary:

  .  Developed a graph neural network model to classify scientific publications into one of seven categories on the Cora dataset, achieving an accuracy of 76% with only 5% of nodes labeled during training.
  
  .  Compared the performance of a traditional MLP model with a GNN model, demonstrating the effectiveness of GNNs in node-level classification tasks on large graphs, with a significant improvement in accuracy from 60% to 76%.
