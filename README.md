# Node-Classification-GNN
.  Project Name: "Node-Level Classification on Citation Networks using Graph Neural Networks"

.  Project Summary:

  .  Developed a graph neural network model to classify scientific publications into one of seven categories on the Cora dataset, achieving an accuracy of 76% with only 5% of nodes labeled during training.
  
  .  Compared the performance of a traditional MLP model with a GNN model, demonstrating the effectiveness of GNNs in node-level classification tasks on large graphs, with a significant improvement in accuracy from 60% to 76%.


# Graph-Level-prediction-GNN

.  Project Name: "Molecule Solubility Prediction using Graph Neural Networks"

.  Project Summary:

     . Developed a graph neural network model to predict the solubility of molecules from their chemical structures, achieving a test loss of 0.496 and average MSE of 0.527 on the ESOL dataset.
     . Utilized a 4-layer GCN architecture with tanh activation, global max-mean pooling, and MSE loss to train the model, demonstrating the   effectiveness of graph neural networks for graph-level regression tasks.
